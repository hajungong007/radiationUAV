## Sensors

In the sensors’ part I surveyed the behaviour of a range of proximity sensors that can potentially be engaged in a UAV project. 
At the beginning, the basic principles of the operation for every type of sensor is explored.  Following this, for the needs of 
the current project, I chose a representative sensor of every type to carry out the experiments.

For each sensor you can find the appropriate skech in order to perform measurements using an Ardiono Uno micro-controller.
At the end you can find two sensor applications as prototypes which can be used as a base to build more sophisticated
approaches.

The schematic representations of the experiments and the related measurement tables are illustrated in a separate section in the appendices, “Sensors Experiments”.  Technical details about the circuits, which were used, and information regarding the source code can be found in the section “Sensor Circuits” in the appendices.

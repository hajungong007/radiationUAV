## Sensors

In the sensorsâ€™ part I surveyed the behaviour of a range of proximity sensors that can potentially be engaged in a UAV project. 
At the beginning, the basic principles of the operation for every type of sensor is explored.  Following this, for the needs of 
the current project, I chose a representative sensor of every type to carry out the experiments.

For each sensor you can find the appropriate skech in order to perform measurements using an Ardiono Uno micro-controller.
At the end you can find two sensor applications as prototypes which can be used as a base to build more sophisticated
approaches.

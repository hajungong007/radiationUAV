iOS  Applications

1. iOS_ROS -
The aim of this application is to implement an immersive interface in order to control a ROS-enabled UAV.  The application is designed in such way that it can facilitate the control during the radiation mapping procedure.  Hence, the operator can set the constant altitude that is desirable for the measurement procedure and then by controlling the linear velocity in x, y as well as the heading, he can manipulate the UAV in a plane parallel to the ground.   Moreover, the scaling of the velocities is adjusted to low levels in order to prevent the fast transitions that could lower the quality of the measurements.

2. iRadiationApp -
The radiation mapping application was designed to give real time connection and feedback from all the functional components in the radiation mapping base unit.  Thus, the operator can have direct information from the Bluetooth link, the GPS connection and the spectrometer device.  In addition to that, the radiation measurements are visualized on a map using color-encoded dots.
